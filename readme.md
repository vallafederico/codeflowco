# Webflow Stuffs

## Stuffs Index

| REFERENCE                  | CURRENT VERSION | DOCS, HOW TO & CONFIG                        |
| :------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Stagger Text Animation** | _v 03_          | [Currrent Docs](/src/staggerText/readme.md)  |

Please be aware that backwards compatibility will be a mess. If a script is running it should keep doing that, but might not be in the same place in the future. When shipping in production please please please download the bundled script from the dist folder and host it yourself, either by making it into a .txt and hosting on webflow or placing it somewhere you control.

### How to use this things.

Ideally you would find the script you need in the dist folder, download it, host it somewhere and link it to your webflow project.

Alternatively (but be mindful that links can break or change) you can find the script you want to use in the dist folder, go to [JsDevlir GitHub Tool](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github), paste the link in there and use the link it gives you.
